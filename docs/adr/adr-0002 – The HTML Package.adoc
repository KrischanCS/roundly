== Decision

The content of the packages `element`, `attribute` , `logic` and `text` will be moved to a new package `html`.

The benefit is the easier usability of the library, especially when working with dot-imports, as it's recommended.

The content in most of them is anyways generated so having one big package does not really make the maintainability worse.

The packages `logic` and `text` are hand written, their original sources will be moved to the generator (internal/generator). They must only be edited there and will be copied to `html` by the generator.
