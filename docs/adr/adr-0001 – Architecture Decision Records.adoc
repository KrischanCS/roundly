The famous first ADR, documenting the decision of using ADRs ;)

== Decision

Decisions done from now in this project will be documented using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

I will not use a template strictly for the moment. In my experience, that often introduces noise to the documents.

Even if working on this on my own and for myself at the moment, it makes sense to me to document some decisions.
I'm not necessarily working in this frequently so this is a way to remember why I made some decisions and what I tried already.

Also, if someone else looks at this it might also make some things clearer.

For what I did already, there are no ADRs, maybe I will add some retroactively to explain a few things.
